5minute
=======

Give me an instance of mine image on OpenStack. Hurry!

QuickStart
----------

To run 5minute you need to install following libs:

::

    python-keystoneclient
    python-cinderclient
    python-heatclient
    python-neutronclient
    python-novaclient
    python-xmltodict
    python-prettytable

To install them from RPMs (Fedora), please do
``dnf -y install $( cat requirement-rpms.txt )``.

If you have installed 5minute using pip, they were installed as
dependencies. Otherwise, you have to install them manually.

Get config file:

1. Login into your OpenStack instance WebUI
2. Navigate to Access & Security -> API Access
3. Save file from "Download OpenStack RC File" to ~/.5minute/config

Get started:

Show help:

::

    $ 5minute help

Upload your SSH public key:

::

    $ 5minute key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Show images we can work with:

::

    $ 5minute images

Boot your machine (consider adding '--name' or '--flavor' to the
command):

::

    $ 5minute boot <image_name_or_id>

When the boot is finished, you should be able to ssh to your new machine

::

    $ ssh root@<machine_ip_address>

You can list your current machines:

::

    $ 5minute list

When you are done, kill the machine (you can do this via OpenStack webUI
as well):

::

    $ 5minute delete <machine_name_or_id>

To list available OpenStack scenarios:

::

    $ 5minute scenario templates

Run scenario:

::

    $ 5minute scenario boot <scenario_template_name>

When finished with the scenario, you should delete it:

::

    $ 5minute scenario delete <scenario_name_or_id>
